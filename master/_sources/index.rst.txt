Welcome to the Python documentation for OPM Flow!
=================================================

There are two Python APIs within OPM Flow:

- running Flow from Python code using the Python bindings (see :doc:`flow-in-python`)
- running a Python script embedded in a simulation (see :doc:`embedded-python`)


This site further contains the documentation of:

- the classes available from OPM Common (see :doc:`common`)
- the classes available from OPM Simulators (see :doc:`simulators`)
